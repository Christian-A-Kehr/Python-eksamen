Python eksamen

Project name: Bilhandler
Short description: 
	using web scraping to collet date and write data to a csv fil. afterwards clean data, 
	use date to show use of applying mathematical and statistical operations.
	last use data to for clustering and classification
List of used technologies
	- data structures (lists and Dictionaries) (done)
	- Loops (done
	- Functions (done)
	- <<<argparse>>> if time (almost rdy just need to be applied to code)
	- Working with Files (done)
	- Object-oriented Programming (may not be needed, but car class is done)
	- Exceptions (have some, but need more)
	- Plotting (not done)
	- Numpy (not sure if is needed)
	- DateTime (used for speed test in modules/web_scraping)
	- Requests (modules/web_scraping getdata())
	- webscraping (modules/web_scraping)
	- clustering (not done)
	- classification (not done)

Installation guide (if any libraries need to be installed)
	- nil 
User guide (how to run the program)
	- run kernel (will use provided csv file)
	alternativ:
	- if user wish to see webscraping provid (argparse here) providing cartype = 'alfa romeo' 
		(will take around 40 sec) 

Status (What has been done (and if anything: what was not done))
	- webscraping (done)
	- filehandling (done)
	- clean up data (not done)
	- classification
	- clustering
